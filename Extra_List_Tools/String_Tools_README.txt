	String Tools Explanation:
	
	
	The string tools are a collection of tools I made for helping me build the lists for the categories. 
	Some of these tools have the same functionality as the category editor and/or the list manager, but are faster to use.
	These are useful for quickly getting raw lists of strings/phrases set up for the list manager/category editor.
	Remember to read the other readme files for more info on getting your lists ready for use in the app.
	Just look at the names to tell what they do. I tried to make the names as descriptive as I could. Open them if you're still unsure.
	These are not the fanciest tools, but they will get the job done.
